We did in our game project class a VR hack-n-slash game which also was my first VR game. 
We had 3 programmers, 2 artists, a designer and a producer in our group. The project was done with Unity (C#) for HTC Vive as our VR platform. 
I did the fireball and some of the AI and ragdoll physics. The project was done in 16 weeks.
